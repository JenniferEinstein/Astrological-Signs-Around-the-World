# What's My...Signs?
Your zodiac signs around the world....
You might think that if you are a water bearer on the Gregorian calendar, you would be a water bearer on the Jewish calendar as well. Not necessarily. This app will explore how different calendars around the world categorize you according to your date of birth.

WhatsMySigns is being created for an assignment for my fellowship at Pursuit Transformation Company. The fellowship is a 12-month, Google-funded software engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate. Project-based curriculum provides hands-on experience with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node, Express, React/Redux, PostgreSQL, APIs, Git, Data Structures, Algorithms, sprints, Agile, code reviews, and pair programming.

<h2>Why <em>this</em> app?</h2> 
As much as I enjoy mobile games, I admit that time spent on them can easily get out of hand. I wanted to create something both fun and finite. In later iterations, zodiac signs from other places around the world will be added. Additionally, more visuals for each sign could change which may prompt people to come back to see what everything looks like. I don't want users to spend more than one or two minutes a day here.
